            <h2>Welcome to Students Against Tyranny - Madison</h2>
            <p>We advocate for student rights within the Madison Local School District in Madison, Ohio. Our mission is to empower students to stand up for their rights, voice concerns, and promote fair treatment for all. We aim to resist any form of tyranny in schools, ensuring that students' voices are heard and respected.</p>
            <p>Students have the right to an appropriate and free public education, receive academic grades based only on academic performance, and be kept informed of all rules, regulations, policies, and penalties to which they may be subjected. They are assured of all due process rights and have the right to personal safety and security while at school and school-sponsored activities. Students also have the right to involvement in school activities without being subjected to discrimination on the basis of race, national origin, marital status, or other protected categories.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to create a supportive environment where students can express their concerns and work collaboratively to address issues affecting their education and well-being.</p>
